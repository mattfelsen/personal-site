    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hi there. I'm a designer and developer based in New York and am currently enrolled in the MFA Design + Technology program at Parsons The New School for Design. I'm interested in all things that lie at the intersection of design & tech, from data visualization to interactive installations, projection mapping, and physical computing. I also love architecture and history. When I can, I enjoy riding my bike, snowboarding, and sailing.
