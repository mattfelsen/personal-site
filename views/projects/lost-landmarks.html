        <h2>Lost Landmarks</h2>
        <p>
            Each day we walk through a city with an amazingly rich history, full of iconic landmarks. Sadly, many of these places can't be seen anymore because they no longer exist, lost perhaps to fire or demolition in the name of progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          The classic binocular viewer has been reimagined and updated with digital technologies to provide a window into the past, allowing you to view and explore historic images in the same location they were captured years ago. At sites throughout Manhattan, peer through a familiar Tower Optical Co. viewer but see something completely unexpected – your surroundings are transformed into those of 100 years past!
